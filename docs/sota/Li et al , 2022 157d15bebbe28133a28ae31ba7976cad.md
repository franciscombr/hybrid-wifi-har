Abstract: Estimating the Doppler frequency is an important part of sensing moving targets in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, such as human tracking and activity recognition. However, it can be highly challenging when there is clock asynchronism between the transmitter (Tx) and the receiver (Rx), in bistatic setups that are common nowadays. In this article, we propose three algorithms for Doppler frequency estimation based on the ratio of channel state information (CSI). These algorithms explore different properties of the CSI ratio, including the circle-preserving property of the Mobius transform, the periodicity of the CSI ratio, and the difference (or correlation) between segments of CSI-ratio signals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can estimate Doppler frequency accurately, outperforming the commonly used approach based on cross-antenna cross correlation (CACC).
