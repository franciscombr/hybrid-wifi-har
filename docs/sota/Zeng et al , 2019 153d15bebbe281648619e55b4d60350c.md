Abstract: The past few years have witnessed the great potential of exploiting channel state information retrieved from commodity WiFi devices for respiration monitoring. However, existing approaches only work when the target is close to the WiFi transceivers and the performance degrades significantly when the target is far away. On the other hand, most home environments only have one WiFi access point and it may not be located in the same room as the target. This sensing range constraint greatly limits the application of the proposed approaches in real life. This paper presents FarSense--the first real-time system that can reliably monitor human respiration when the target is far away from the WiFi transceiver pair. FarSense works well even when one of the transceivers is located in another room, moving a big step towards real-life deployment. We propose two novel schemes to achieve this goal: (1) Instead of applying the raw CSI readings of individual antenna for sensing, we employ the ratio of CSI readings from two antennas, whose noise is mostly canceled out by the division operation to significantly increase the sensing range; (2) The division operation further enables us to utilize the phase information which is not usable with one single antenna for sensing. The orthogonal amplitude and phase are elaborately combined to address the "blind spots" issue and further increase the sensing range. Extensive experiments show that FarSense is able to accurately monitor human respiration even when the target is 8 meters away from the transceiver pair, increasing the sensing range by more than 100%. We believe this is the first system to enable through-wall respiration sensing with commodity WiFi devices and the proposed method could also benefit other sensing applications.

### Overview

- Objective
    - To develop a WiFi-based sensing system, *FarSense*, capable of monitoring human respiration from a significantly increased range (up to 8-9 meters) using commodity WiFi hardware. The approach focuses on utilizing the ratio of Channel State Information (CSI) readings from two antennas to enhance the signal quality and address traditional limitations like noise and blind spots.
- Key Contributions
    - **CSI Ratio Model:** Introduced a novel metric, the CSI ratio, which combines the amplitude and phase of two antennas' readings to cancel noise and achieve stable phase information for sensing.
    - **Sensing Range Enhancement:** Increased sensing range from 2-4 meters (state-of-the-art) to 8-9 meters while maintaining 100% detection rate.
    - **Through-Wall Respiration Sensing:** Demonstrated the systemâ€™s ability to monitor respiration even when one transceiver is located in a different room.
    - **Robust Design:** Mitigated blind spots and improved performance in challenging scenarios by combining complementary amplitude and phase features.

### Methods

- **Approach/Architecture:**
    - **Data Collection:**
        - Used Intel 5300 WiFi cards to collect CSI data at 100 Hz from 30 subcarriers.
        - Two antennas on the receiver and one on the transmitter.
    - **Data Preprocessing:**
        - Calculated the ratio of CSI readings from two antennas.
        - Applied motion detection to exclude large motion periods.
        - Smoothed CSI ratio using a Savitzky-Golay filter.
    - **Respiration Pattern Extraction:**
        - Projected the CSI ratio in the complex plane, combining amplitude and phase components.
        - Generated multiple projections and selected the best candidate using a Breathing-to-Noise Ratio (BNR) metric.
    - **Respiration Rate Estimation:**
        - Applied autocorrelation to respiration patterns of subcarriers.
        - Combined results from selected subcarriers for robust estimation.

    - Reliable operation in **Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS)** scenarios, such as through a wall or when transceivers were mounted on the ceiling.
- **Comparison to Baselines**
    - **HRD:** Limited to 2.9 meters with poor detection rates beyond 3 meters.
